I am a second-year Economics and Computer Science double-major at Yale University, passionate about development and financial economics, data science, and algorithmic finance. I am fascinated by the intersections between Economics, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and I look forward to exploring them further in my next years at Yale. I have experience with Python, Excel, C, SQL, and Racket, and I continue to build data analysis and machine learning skills. Next year, I hope to develop my skillset and discover more about my interests by engaging in pre-professional activities, such as finance clubs and research opportunities. Please reach me at gabriel.thomazvieira@yale.edu for any questions.
